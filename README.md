# Movie Rental (.Net) – Refactoring Kata

This repository contains an implementation in C# of the classic Movie Rental Refactoring Kata, originally popularized by Martin Fowler in Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code.
The goal of this project is to practice incremental refactoring, clean code principles, and test-driven development, starting from an intentionally messy codebase.

Here is the link of the repository used to do this exercise :
